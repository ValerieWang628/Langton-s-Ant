# Langton's Ant

This is a project inspired by Daniel Shiffman. I was very impressed with the simple rules which generates amazing patterns. 
Spent 20 mins to implement this via Python on the train from NYC to Pitt.
And later there will be more variations, such as hexagon grids, multiple colors, and hopefully 3D implementations.
